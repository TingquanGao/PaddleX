## 2. Quick Start
PaddleX's pre-trained model pipelines can be quickly experienced. You can experience the effect of the Document Scene Information Extraction v3 pipeline online or locally using Python.

### 2.1 Online Experience
You can [experience online](https://aistudio.baidu.com/community/app/182491/webUI) the effect of the Document Scene Information Extraction v3 pipeline, using the official demo images for recognition, for example:

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa261b2b-b79c-4487-9323-dfcc43c3d581)

If you are satisfied with the pipeline's performance, you can directly integrate and deploy it. If not, you can also use your private data to **fine-tune the models in the pipeline online**.

### 2.2 Local Experience
Before using the PP-ChatOCRv3 pipeline locally, please ensure you have installed the PaddleX wheel package following the [PaddleX Local Installation Guide](../../../installation/installation_en.md).

A few lines of code are all you need to complete the quick inference of the pipeline. Using the [test file](https://paddle-model-ecology.bj.bcebos.com/paddlex/imgs/demo_image/contract.pdf), taking the PP-ChatOCRv3-doc pipeline as an example:

```python
from paddlex import create_pipeline

pipeline = create_pipeline(
    pipeline="PP-ChatOCRv3-doc",
    llm_name="ernie-3.5",
    llm_params={"api_type": "qianfan", "ak": "", "sk": ""} # Please enter your ak and sk; otherwise, the large model cannot be invoked.
    # llm_params={"api_type": "aistudio", "access_token": ""} # Please enter your access_token; otherwise, the large model cannot be invoked.
    )

visual_result, visual_info = pipeline.visual_predict("https://paddle-model-ecology.bj.bcebos.com/paddlex/imgs/demo_image/contract.pdf")

for res in visual_result:
    res.save_to_img("./output")
    res.save_to_html('./output')
    res.save_to_xlsx('./output')

vector = pipeline.build_vector(visual_info=visual_info)

chat_result = pipeline.chat(
    key_list=["乙方", "手机号"],
    visual_info=visual_info,
    vector=vector,
    )
chat_result.print()
```
**Note**: Currently, the large language model only supports Ernie. You can obtain the relevant ak/sk (access_token) on the [Baidu Cloud Qianfan Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/qianfan/ais/console/onlineService) or [Baidu AIStudio Community](https://aistudio.baidu.com/). If you use the Baidu Cloud Qianfan Platform, you can refer to the [AK and SK Authentication API Calling Process](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/WENXINWORKSHOP/s/Hlwerugt8) to obtain ak/sk. If you use Baidu AIStudio Community, you can obtain the access_token from the [Baidu AIStudio Community Access Token](https://aistudio.baidu.com/account/accessToken).

After running, the output is as follows:

```
{'chat_res': {'乙方': '股份测试有限公司', '手机号': '19331729920'}, 'prompt': ''}
```

In the above Python script, the following steps are executed:

(1) Call the `create_pipeline` to instantiate a PP-ChatOCRv3-doc pipeline object, related parameters descriptions are as follows:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| `pipeline` | str | None | Pipeline name or pipeline configuration file path. If it's a pipeline name, it must be supported by PaddleX; |
| `llm_name` | str | "ernie-3.5" | Large Language Model name, we support `ernie-4.0` and `ernie-3.5`, with more models on the way.|
| `llm_params` | dict | `{}` | API configuration; |
| `device(kwargs)` | str/`None` | `None` | Running device (`None` meaning automatic selection); |

(2) Call the `visual_predict` of the PP-ChatOCRv3-doc pipeline object to visual predict, related parameters descriptions are as follows:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|`input`|Python Var|-|Support to pass Python variables directly, such as `numpy.ndarray` representing image data;|
|`input`|str|-|Support to pass the path of the file to be predicted, such as the local path of an image file: `/root/data/img.jpg`;|
|`input`|str|-|Support to pass the URL of the file to be predicted, such as: `https://paddle-model-ecology.bj.bcebos.com/paddlex/imgs/demo_image/contract.pdf`;|
|`input`|str|-|Support to pass the local directory, which should contain files to be predicted, such as: `/root/data/`;|
|`input`|dict|-|Support to pass a dictionary, where the key needs to correspond to the specific pipeline, such as: `{"img": "/root/data1"}`；|
|`input`|list|-|Support to pass a list, where the elements must be of the above types of data, such as: `[numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray]`，`["/root/data/img1.jpg", "/root/data/img2.jpg"]`，`["/root/data1", "/root/data2"]`，`[{"img": "/root/data1"}, {"img": "/root/data2/img.jpg"}]`；|
|`use_doc_image_ori_cls_model`|bool|`True`|Whether or not to use the orientation classification model;|
|`use_doc_image_unwarp_model`|bool|`True`|Whether or not to use the unwarp model;|
|`use_seal_text_det_model`|bool|`True`|Whether or not to use the seal text detection model;|

(3) Call the relevant functions of prediction object to save the prediction results. The related functions are as follows:

|Function|Parameter|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`save_to_img`|`save_path`|Save OCR prediction results, layout results, and table recognition results as image files, with the parameter `save_path` used to specify the save path;|
|`save_to_html`|`save_path`|Save the table recognition results as an HTML file, with the parameter 'save_path' used to specify the save path;|
|`save_to_xlsx`|`save_path`|Save the table recognition results as an Excel file, with the parameter 'save_path' used to specify the save path;|

(4) Call the `chat` of PP-ChatOCRv3-doc pipeline object to query information with LLM, related parameters are described as follows:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
|`key_list`|str|-|Keywords used to query. A string composed of multiple keywords with "," as separators, such as "Party B, phone number";|
|`key_list`|list|-|Keywords used to query. A list composed of multiple keywords.|

(3) Obtain prediction results by calling the `predict` method: The `predict` method is a `generator`, so prediction results need to be obtained through calls. The `predict` method predicts data in batches, so the prediction results are represented as a list of prediction results.

(4) Interact with the large model by calling the `predict.chat` method, which takes as input keywords (multiple keywords are supported) for information extraction. The prediction results are represented as a list of information extraction results.

(5) Process the prediction results: The prediction result for each sample is in the form of a dict, which supports printing or saving to a file. The supported file types depend on the specific pipeline, such as:

| Method | Description | Method Parameters |
|-|-|-|
| save_to_img | Saves layout analysis, table recognition, etc. results as image files. | `save_path`: str, the file path to save. |
| save_to_html | Saves table recognition results as HTML files. | `save_path`: str, the file path to save. |
| save_to_xlsx | Saves table recognition results as Excel files. | `save_path`: str, the file path to save. |

When executing the above command, the default Pipeline configuration file is loaded. If you need to customize the configuration file, you can use the following command to obtain it:

```bash
paddlex --get_pipeline_config PP-ChatOCRv3-doc
```

After execution, the configuration file for the PP-ChatOCRv3-doc pipeline will be saved in the current path. If you wish to customize the save location, you can execute the following command (assuming the custom save location is `./my_path`):

```bash
paddlex --get_pipeline_config PP-ChatOCRv3-doc --save_path ./my_path
```
After obtaining the configuration file, you can customize the various configurations of the PP-ChatOCRv3-doc pipeline:

```yaml
Pipeline:
  layout_model: RT-DETR-H_layout_3cls
  table_model: SLANet_plus
  text_det_model: PP-OCRv4_server_det
  text_rec_model: PP-OCRv4_server_rec
  seal_text_det_model: PP-OCRv4_server_seal_det
  doc_image_ori_cls_model: null
  doc_image_unwarp_model: null
  llm_name: "ernie-3.5"
  llm_params:
    api_type: qianfan
    ak:
    sk:
```

In the above configuration, you can modify the models loaded by each module of the pipeline, as well as the large language model used. Please refer to the module documentation for the list of supported models for each module, and the list of supported large language models includes: ernie-4.0, ernie-3.5, ernie-3.5-8k, ernie-lite, ernie-tiny-8k, ernie-speed, ernie-speed-128k, ernie-char-8k.

After making modifications, simply update the `pipeline` parameter value in the `create_pipeline` method to the path of your pipeline configuration file to apply the configuration.

For example, if your configuration file is saved at `./my_path/PP-ChatOCRv3-doc.yaml`, you would execute:

```python
from paddlex import create_pipeline

pipeline = create_pipeline(
    pipeline="./my_path/PP-ChatOCRv3-doc.yaml",
    llm_name="ernie-3.5",
    llm_params={"api_type": "qianfan", "ak": "", "sk": ""} # Please enter your ak and sk; otherwise, the large model cannot be invoked.
    # llm_params={"api_type": "aistudio", "access_token": ""} # Please enter your access_token; otherwise, the large model cannot be invoked.
    )

visual_result, visual_info = pipeline.visual_predict("https://paddle-model-ecology.bj.bcebos.com/paddlex/imgs/demo_image/contract.pdf")

for res in visual_result:
    res.save_to_img("./output")
    res.save_to_html('./output')
    res.save_to_xlsx('./output')

vector = pipeline.build_vector(visual_info=visual_info)

chat_result = pipeline.chat(
    key_list=["乙方", "手机号"],
    visual_info=visual_info,
    vector=vector,
    )
chat_result.print()
```

## 3. Development Integration/Deployment
If the pipeline meets your requirements for inference speed and accuracy, you can proceed directly with development integration/deployment.

If you need to directly apply the pipeline in your Python project, you can refer to the example code in [2.2 Local Experience](#22-python-script-integration).

Additionally, PaddleX provides three other deployment methods, detailed as follows:

🚀 **High-Performance Inference**: In actual production environments, many applications have stringent standards for the performance metrics (especially response speed) of deployment strategies to ensure efficient system operation and smooth user experience. To this end, PaddleX provides high-performance inference plugins aimed at deeply optimizing model inference and pre/post-processing to significantly speed up the end-to-end process. For detailed high-performance inference procedures, please refer to the [PaddleX High-Performance Inference Guide](../../../pipeline_deploy/high_performance_inference_en.md).

☁️ **Service-Oriented Deployment**: Service-oriented deployment is a common deployment form in actual production environments. By encapsulating inference functions as services, clients can access these services through network requests to obtain inference results. PaddleX supports users in achieving low-cost service-oriented deployment of pipelines. For detailed service-oriented deployment procedures, please refer to the [PaddleX Service-Oriented Deployment Guide](../../../pipeline_deploy/service_deploy_en.md).

Below are the API references and multi-language service invocation examples:

📱 **Edge Deployment**: Edge deployment is a method that places computing and data processing functions on user devices themselves, allowing devices to process data directly without relying on remote servers. PaddleX supports deploying models on edge devices such as Android. For detailed edge deployment procedures, please refer to the [PaddleX Edge Deployment Guide](../../../pipeline_deploy/lite_deploy_en.md).

## 4. Custom Development

If the default model weights provided by the PP-ChatOCRv3-doc Pipeline do not meet your requirements in terms of accuracy or speed for your specific scenario, you can attempt to further **fine-tune** the existing models using **your own domain-specific or application-specific data** to enhance the recognition performance of the general table recognition pipeline in your scenario.

### 4.1 Model Fine-tuning

Since the PP-ChatOCRv3-doc Pipeline comprises six modules, unsatisfactory performance may stem from any of these modules (note that the text image rectification module does not support customization at this time).

You can analyze images with poor recognition results and follow the guidelines below for analysis and model fine-tuning:

* Incorrect table structure detection (e.g., row/column misidentification, cell position errors) may indicate deficiencies in the table structure recognition module. You need to refer to the **Customization** section in the [Table Structure Recognition Module Development Tutorial](../../../module_usage/tutorials/ocr_modules/table_structure_recognition_en.md) and fine-tune the table structure recognition model using your private dataset.

* Misplaced layout elements (e.g., incorrect positioning of tables or seals) may suggest issues with the layout detection module. Consult the **Customization** section in the [Layout Detection Module Development Tutorial](../../../module_usage/tutorials/ocr_modules/layout_detection_en.md) and fine-tune the layout detection model with your private dataset.

* Frequent undetected text (i.e., text leakage) may indicate limitations in the text detection model. Refer to the **Customization** section in the [Text Detection Module Development Tutorial](../../../module_usage/tutorials/ocr_modules/text_detection_en.md) and fine-tune the text detection model using your private dataset.

* High text recognition errors (i.e., recognized text content does not match the actual text) suggest that the text recognition model requires improvement. Follow the **Customization** section in the [Text Recognition Module Development Tutorial](../../../module_usage/tutorials/ocr_modules/text_recognition_en.md) to fine-tune the text recognition model.

* Frequent recognition errors in detected seal text indicate that the seal text detection model needs further refinement. Consult the **Customization** section in the [Seal Text Detection Module Development Tutorials](../../../module_usage/tutorials/ocr_modules/seal_text_detection_en.md) to fine-tune the seal text detection model.

* Frequent misidentifications of document or certificate orientations with text regions suggest that the document image orientation classification model requires improvement. Refer to the **Customization** section in the [Document Image Orientation Classification Module Development Tutorial](../../../module_usage/tutorials/ocr_modules/doc_img_orientation_classification_en.md) to fine-tune the document image orientation classification model.

### 4.2 Model Deployment

After fine-tuning your models using your private dataset, you will obtain local model weights files.

To use the fine-tuned model weights, simply modify the pipeline configuration file by replacing the local paths of the default model weights with those of your fine-tuned models:

```yaml
......
Pipeline:
  layout_model: RT-DETR-H_layout_3cls  # Replace with the local path of your fine-tuned model
  table_model: SLANet_plus  # Replace with the local path of your fine-tuned model
  text_det_model: PP-OCRv4_server_det  # Replace with the local path of your fine-tuned model
  text_rec_model: PP-OCRv4_server_rec  # Replace with the local path of your fine-tuned model
  seal_text_det_model: PP-OCRv4_server_seal_det  # Replace with the local path of your fine-tuned model
  doc_image_ori_cls_model: null   # Replace with the local path of your fine-tuned model if applicable
  doc_image_unwarp_model: null   # Replace with the local path of your fine-tuned model if applicable
......
```

Subsequently, load the modified pipeline configuration file using the command-line interface or Python script as described in the local experience section.

## 5. Multi-hardware Support
PaddleX supports various mainstream hardware devices such as NVIDIA GPUs, Kunlun XPU, Ascend NPU, and Cambricon MLU. **Seamless switching between different hardware can be achieved by simply setting the `--device` parameter**.

For example, to perform inference using the PP-ChatOCRv3-doc Pipeline on an NVIDIA GPU.
At this point, if you wish to switch the hardware to Ascend NPU, simply modify the `--device` in the script to `npu`:

```python
from paddlex import create_pipeline
pipeline = create_pipeline(
    pipeline="PP-ChatOCRv3-doc",
    llm_name="ernie-3.5",
    llm_params={"api_type": "qianfan", "ak": "", "sk": ""},
    device="npu:0" # gpu:0 --> npu:0
    )
```

If you want to use the PP-ChatOCRv3-doc Pipeline on more types of hardware, please refer to the [PaddleX Multi-Device Usage Guide](../../../installation/multi_devices_use_guide_en.md).
